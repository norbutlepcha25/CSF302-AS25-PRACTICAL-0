Algorithm Design and Analysis praticals

1. Write a program to store random numbers into an array of n integers and then find out the smallest and largest number stored in it. n is the user input..
2. Implement the Binary Search algorithm
3. Write a program to calculate the area/volumes of :
    - circle
    - Sphere
    - Cone
    - Pyramid
    - Cylinder
    - Rectangle
    - Custom Polygonal shape ( example n = 5, 6, â€¦)

4. Implement the Fibonacci Sequence
5. Given an array, count how many times each element appears (frequency count).
6. Find the second largest element in an array.
7. Implement linear Search Algorithm
8. Write a program to store random numbers into an array of n integers, where the array must contain some duplicates. Do the following:
    - Find out the total number of duplicate elements..
    - Find out the most repeating element in the array
